File Handling -> work on file

Create File -> syntax
variableName = open("filename.extension","filemode")
e.g
mylaptopPassword = open("password.txt","w")

Write file -> syntax
e.g. mylaptopPassword.write("guhiguhi")

Read from file
e.g mylaptopPassword.read()

Delete file
import os
os.remove("password.txt")
